# BddSpec

Currently, a proof of concept only

## Things to do

* Make the execution steps more clear, try to unify the boolean verifications creating meaningful conjunctions
* Search how to create a CLI, dotnet tool, nuget package
* Print it better
* Search how to inform the terminal that not all tests passed (exit 0 os something like that)
* Add all the test types
* Test especific class / line number
* Understands how to integrate with assertions libraries
* Protect test discoverer and test execution from possible errors
* Protect the entire suit from possible errors and show it
* For a paralel execution find a non blocking way to write on the console
* Verify if has a better way to ident things on terminal
* Print errors without exceptions at end end

## Completed

* ~~Add after stack execution~~
* ~~Ident errors better~~
* ~~Treat and show exceptions~~
* ~~Specify and work with input args to configure the output~~
* ~~Try to reduce a little of the recursion repetition~~
* ~~Print the statistics at the end of the execution~~
